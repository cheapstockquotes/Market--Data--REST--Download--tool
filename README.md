# Market  Data  REST  Download  tool
CheapStockQuotes provides a reliable and cost effective market data feed for 
web sites and application developers via a REST API. Response data is realtime (non-delayed) dating back to 1980. Cheapstockquotes has all U.S. Stocks, Futures, Indexes, ETFs, Funds and International Currencies and some Crypto Currencies. We've recently added Extended, Pre-market and Post-market price data to the service.
